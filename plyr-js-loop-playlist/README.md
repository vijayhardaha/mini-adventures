# plyr-js-loop-playlist

It is a simple HTML project that showcases how to create a looped playlist of videos using Plyr.js. This project is served using Parcel.js and demonstrates a straightforward way to create a seamless video looping experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd plyr-js-loop-playlist
   ```

2. Install project dependencies using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the project using Parcel.js. This will start a local development server and open the project in your default web browser.

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can now access the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:1234` (or another URL provided by Parcel.js). You'll see a page with multiple video cards that play videos using Plyr.js. The videos are displayed in an HTML popup, and when one video ends, the next video in the playlist starts, creating a continuous loop of video playback.

## Customizing the Playlist

If you want to customize the playlist, you can edit the HTML file to add or remove videos and their respective information. You can also customize the video playback settings and appearance using the Plyr.js documentation and configuration options.
